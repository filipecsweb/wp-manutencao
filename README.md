# WordPress Manutencao

Set your WordPress website for maintenance in a simple way. At the same time you have some options like:
* Deactivate maintenance mode without deactivating the plugin itself.
* Choose between two maintenance types: HTML Maintenance Page or you can set a redirecting URL to redirect the user to.
* Build your own maintenance page using your own HTML, CSS and JavasScript. Or you can always use the default maintenance page template.
* Only logged admins can see the website, but you can set as many IP addresses as you want which can also have access.

### Prerequisites

You have to install this plugin in an WordPress installation.

### Installing
